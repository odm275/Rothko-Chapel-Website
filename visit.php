    <h2>Chapel Grounds.</h2>
    <p>
      The Rothko Chapel grounds are a welcoming, calming green space.
      The grounds act as an extension of the Chapel itself, making them an ideal place to reflect on your experience of the Chapel
      and the Broken Obelisk, or simply have a moment of solitude and escape from the outside world.
      We invite you to come, immerse yourself in the tranquility of the grounds, and experience the stillness.
